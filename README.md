# todo_app
SwiftUI app that tracks your todo-tasks:

Main features:
1. Track your progress on your tasks for the day
2. Create multiple ToDo lists and track your completed items and previous lists
3. Use Gemini to get feedback on your tasks! 

## Coming soon:
- Timed reminders for task completion (e.g. Remind me to do Task X at 12:00 PM)
- Set tasks as high priority, and filter by high priority tasks
- Create and track list groups (Personal, Work, Studying, etc.)
